# Dimensional Data Modeling - Actor Films Analysis
This project focuses on creating an efficient dimensional data model for the actor_films dataset. 
By defining data structures, SQL queries, Cumulative Table Design and implementing type 2 slowly changing dimensions (SCD), 
this project supports advanced analysis of actor performance and film history.

## Data Overview 
The actor_films dataset contains the following fields:

actor: The name of the actor.
actorid: A unique identifier for each actor (Primary Key Component).
film: The name of the film.
